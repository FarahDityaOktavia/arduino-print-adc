# Arduino Print ADC

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), is an electronic circuit that measures real-world signals, such as temperature, pressure, or sound, and converts them into a digital representation. This process is essential for interfacing analog signals with digital systems, such as microcontrollers and computers. This program for print ADC values from analog sensor
